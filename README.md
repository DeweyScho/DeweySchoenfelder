👋 Hi, I'm Thomas Dewey Schoenfelder

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate and developer passionate about artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, and algorithm optimization.
I’ve built deep RL agents, robotics simulations, and computer vision tools — and I’m always learning.

Tech Stack
- Languages: Python, Java, C/C++, MATLAB
- Frameworks & Tools: PyTorch, OpenCV, Git, Raspberry Pi
- Concepts: Reinforcement Learning (DQN, A2C, PPO), Computer Vision, Systems Programming

Projects
Here are a few of my highlighted works:

- [TicTacToe-DQN](https://github.com/DeweyScho/TicTacToe-DQN) – Deep Q-Learning agent that plays Tic Tac Toe and learns optimal strategy through self-play.
- [CatchGame-DQN](https://github.com/DeweyScho/CatchGame-DQN) – Custom environment + DQN training for a reflex-based catching game.
- [CartPole-PPO](https://github.com/DeweyScho/CartPole-PPO) – Policy gradient agent with Proximal Policy Optimization on CartPole using PyTorch.
